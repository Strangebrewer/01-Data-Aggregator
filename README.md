# Data Aggregator

Bootcamp assignment using Express.js and Handlebars for the first time. It's a quiz used to find friends who gave similar answers. Or it's just another way to gather data about users. Bootcamp called it a Friend Finder app.

Mine is deployed on Heroku [here](https://o1-data-aggregator.herokuapp.com/) if you want to check it out.
